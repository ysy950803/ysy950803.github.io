#### The origin of my blog name

Having a piggy kitten, I just don't have a good idea for the blog name, so call it 'Pig Cat' simply.

#### A few words

Do tiny jobs and share some **life lessons**. Write by heart as a developer.

Man is mortal, being lighter than a feather its lightness could not be measured thousands of years ago, but can be measured in modern times.

If my articles are helpful to you, you can turn off the ad blocking plug-in (or turn on incognito mode) and tap some advertisements, which is also a kind of support for me.
